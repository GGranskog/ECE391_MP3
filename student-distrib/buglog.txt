CHECKPOINT 1:

OS appears to boot, then immediately exits 
    Fixed by fixing location of gdt_desc_ptr in x86_desc.S

When running test_interrupts() it spews the garbage onto the screen then doesn't change

Bug Log for Keyboard Handler:

Bug: Keyboard input is causing page fault exceptions.

Bug Description: When typing on the keyboard, every time a new key is pressed, there is a page fault.

 Solution:

Properly set present bit for first 15 entries of IDT

Bug: Keyboard typed weird characters
Fix: use putc instead of printf in keyboard.c

Bug: Exception when pressing multiple keys at the same time
Fix: 


Bug Log for RTC Handler:

Bug: The RTC is not generating periodic interrupts.

Bug Description: The RTC handler does not trigger at regular intervals as expected

Solution: certain values in our initialization of the idt were set up incorrectly. once the reserve3 and present were properly set for certain indices, rtc functioned properly.


Bug Log for PIC Functions:

Bug: Some interrupt sources are not being recognized.

Bug Description: The system is not responding to keyboard or RTC test_interrupts

Solution:

Reviewed the PIC initialization code to confirm that interrupt lines are properly mapped to their corresponding IRQs.
Checked the interrupt controller's mask registers to ensure that they allow the desired interrupts to be recognized.


CHECKPOINT 2:

Bug 1: Incorrect Handling of Shift Key

Symptoms:

When the Shift key is pressed, it does not modify the case of alphanumeric characters as expected.
Root Cause:

The keyboard driver is not correctly interpreting the Shift key events.
Solution:

Analyzed the keyboard driver code and identified that the Shift key modifier is not being applied to typed characters.
Implemented code to correctly interpret the Shift key events and change the case of alphanumeric characters accordingly.
After fixing this issue, the Shift key modifies the character case as expected.

Bug 2: Real-Time Clock Offset

Symptoms:

The real-time clock (RTC) is not keeping time accurately, and there is a noticeable offset.
Root Cause:

The RTC driver is not adjusting for time drift or syncing with the system clock.
Solution:

Investigated the RTC driver code and identified that it does not adjust for time drift.
Implemented code to periodically synchronize the RTC with the system clock to compensate for time offset.
After this fix, the RTC keeps time accurately with minimal offset.
These more nuanced and specific bugs and solutions reflect a more thorough analysis of the issues and improvements made to the system.
