CHECKPOINT 1:

OS appears to boot, then immediately exits 
    Fixed by fixing location of gdt_desc_ptr in x86_desc.S

When running test_interrupts() it spews the garbage onto the screen then doesn't change

Bug Log for Keyboard Handler:

Bug: Keyboard input is causing page fault exceptions.

Bug Description: When typing on the keyboard, every time a new key is pressed, there is a page fault.

 Solution:

Checked the keyboard array to ensure that it correctly maps scan codes to characters for the specific keyboard layout in use.
Verified that the scan code interpretation matches the keyboard layout being used.


Bug Log for RTC Handler:

Bug: The RTC is not generating periodic interrupts.

Bug Description: The RTC handler does not trigger at regular intervals as expected

Solution:

Reviewed the RTC initialization code to ensure that the periodic interrupt generation is properly configured.
Checked the handler's code to verify that it's correctly acknowledging and handling RTC interrupts.

Bug Log for PIC Functions:

Bug: Some interrupt sources are not being recognized.

Bug Description: The system is not responding to keyboard or RTC test_interrupts

Solution:

Reviewed the PIC initialization code to confirm that interrupt lines are properly mapped to their corresponding IRQs.
Checked the interrupt controller's mask registers to ensure that they allow the desired interrupts to be recognized.
